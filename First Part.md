# Step 1
Use a text editor. A text editor is something like notepad, vim, and atom. There are many different text editors you can you and they are simply for you to put your code.
For this tutorial I will use atom to create the code.

# Step 2
1. Load up your text editor.
2. Go to **File** and create a new file
# Now you are ready to enter html.
3. On the first line you should enter. <!DOCTYPE html> This decares the document type and telling the editor that you are using html.
4. Next you should get familar with how to input your information.
- `<html>  </html>`
Inbetween these tags is where the html code should go. It should be the very first and very last thing for your code. 
- `<head>  </head>` 
This is the heading of your document and will show up in the tab.
- `<body>  </body>`
This is what will be shown on the page of your document. This is where we will see pac man.

**Remember that when you open a tag you must close it with the forward slash.**
